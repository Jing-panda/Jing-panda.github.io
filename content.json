There are too many things happening everyday, and things are repeating from time to time, I realize I need to go back to the same thing I have been done, and need to re-use the same of amount of time to figure out how to do it. It is quite frustrating, and time-consuming. I hope this blog could help me to be more organized, and make my life easier. Where to start to write a blogI start to search online: what is the best website to write a blog! There are so many options. I started to try the most popular blog designer WordPress.org, there are so many steps to set up, and after trying to install all the software, at the end I give up, I think it is not really for beginners. Then I also tried WIX, it is easy to start, and have many options to make the blog looks very nice, may will go back to continue to try to build my own website. But I didn’t finish because I think that website is not what I wanted, I want to have a straightforward website where I could just easily note down what I have been done. Then I came across a webpage where people share their experience and knowledge of living in Denmark , which looks great, very clean, simple, and organized! Then I saw the logo of Hexo, that’s where I finally decided to start my first blog. How to set up HexoHexo is a great way to create a simple website. It works well for blogs, resume sites. It is already very popular and have many people used it for blogging, so very easy to find tutorials to set up Hexo. Just a short summary here: Step 1: Install Node.js (Check if success by enter node -v in CMD) Step 2: Install Git (Check if success by enter git --version in CMD) Step 3: Register a Git account, and create a new repository for storing the final created blog/web, gave a name of the repository end with .github.io Step 4: Install Hexo blog using NPM (typing npm i hexo-cli -g in CMD ​ check if success by typing hexo -v Step 5: Clone Hexo blog field hexo init blog Step 6: Switch to the blog directory cd blog and npm install **Step 7: **Connect Git with local Open git bash, and type in the following lines separately git config --global user.name &quot;yourGitUserName&quot; git config -- global user.email &quot;Email used for Git&quot; ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;Email used for Git&quot; Press Enter ** three times, then the key has been generated in the location, go to the file and open the file ‘.ssh/id_rsa.pub’ by notepad, and copy everything in the file. Go to Github, and clik the profile image, and choose under the opened list-setting, and then choose **==SSH and GPG keys== to create a new SSH key, give a random name, and paste everything to the key box. Check if it is success by enter ssh -T &#x67;&#105;&#116;&#x40;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#104;&#x75;&#x62;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d; in Git bash, if it is the first time, then it will give the following warning Just choose “yes”, then it will show the following message: So it is succesed! **Step 8: ** Change the address to git repositionary ​ Under the blog folder generate in step 5, open the _config.yml file with notepad, and change the last part to the following, the repository is the one you create from step 3.","categories":[{"name":"Tool","slug":"Tool","permalink":"https://jing-panda/Jing-panda.github.io/categories/Tool/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Machine learning -linear regression","slug":"Machine learning","date":"2020-11-18T19:54:34.000Z","updated":"2020-12-04T14:41:16.147Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/18/Machine learning/","link":"","permalink":"https://jing-panda/Jing-panda.github.io/2020/11/18/Machine%20learning/","excerpt":"Linear regressionOverview[toc] Cross-Validation with Linear RegressionLinear regressionGenerally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations.

Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them. In other words, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well. The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses. The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors. Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries. $y=\\beta_0 +\\beta_1x_1 +…+\\beta_rx_x+𝜀$ This equation is the regression equation. y is the dependent variable, 𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ are the independent variables, 𝛽₀, 𝛽₁, …, 𝛽ᵣ are the regression coefficients, and 𝜀 is the random error. The estimated or predicted response, 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ), for each observation 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛, should be as close as possible to the corresponding actual response 𝑦ᵢ. The differences 𝑦ᵢ - 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ) for all observations 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛, are called the residuals. Regression is about determining the best predicted weights, that is the weights corresponding to the smallest residuals. To get the best weights, you usually minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR) for all observations 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛: SSR = Σᵢ(𝑦ᵢ - 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ))². This approach is called the method of ordinary least squares. The variation of actual responses 𝑦ᵢ, 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛, occurs partly due to the dependence on the predictors 𝐱ᵢ. However, there is also an additional inherent variance of the output. The coefficient of determination, denoted as 𝑅², tells you which amount of variation in 𝑦 can be explained by the dependence on 𝐱 using the particular regression model. Larger 𝑅² indicates a better fit and means that the model can better explain the variation of the output with different inputs. The value 𝑅² = 1 corresponds to SSR = 0, that is to the perfect fit since the values of predicted and actual responses fit completely to each other. A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text. In markdown source code, paragraphs are separated by two or more blank lines. In Typora, you only need one blank line (press Return once) to create a new paragraph. Press Shift + Return to create a single line break. Most other markdown parsers will ignore single line breaks, so in order to make other markdown parsers recognize your line break, you can leave two spaces at the end of the line, or insert &lt;br/&gt;.
